XAMPP Setup for PHP Code
This code includes PHP code that is designed to run on a web server, and in order to run it locally, you will need to set up a web server on your computer. One of the easiest ways to do this is to use XAMPP, a popular open-source web server software package.

Installation Steps
Download and install XAMPP from the official website: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
Launch XAMPP and start the Apache and MySQL servers.
Place the PHP code in the htdocs folder of your XAMPP installation directory.
Import the database included in the db.sql file using phpMyAdmin or another database management tool.
Update the db_connection.php file with the correct database credentials.
Access the PHP code by navigating to http://localhost/<path-to-php-file> in your web browser.
Code Explanation
The PHP code is designed to handle user registration and login functionality. The register_form.php file includes a form for users to enter their information and register for an account, and the login_form.php file includes a form for users to enter their login credentials and access their account.

The PHP code uses a MySQL database to store user information, and the db_connection.php file includes the database credentials and a function for establishing a connection to the database.

When a user registers for an account, the PHP code inserts their information into the database and sends an email to the user to verify their email address.

When a user logs in, the PHP code retrieves their information from the database and checks their password to verify their identity. If the user's login credentials are correct, they are redirected to the dashboard.php page.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with the PHP code, check the error logs in XAMPP to see if there are any error messages that can help diagnose the issue.
If you encounter issues with sending emails from the PHP code, check that your email settings in php.ini and the php_mailer.php file are configured correctly.
If you encounter issues with the MySQL database, check that your database credentials in db_connection.php are correct and that the db.sql file has been imported correctly.
